# C-to-LLVM-IR-Compiler
A compiler that converts a simplified form of the C programming language into LLVM IR which can be compiled and run with Clang. Written entirely in C.

This compiler is capable of handling variable declaration, assignment, logical and arithmetic expression evaluation, print statements, integer input, error messaging, if-else branches, and while loops.

# SimpleC Syntax (Informally)
This simplified form of C is mostly similar to conventional C with only a few exceptions.

1.	All variable declarations must occur at the start of the program.
	### Correct
	```
	int x;
	int y;
	x = 2;
	y = 4;
	print x + y;
	```
	### Incorrect
	```
	int x;
	x = 2;
	int y;
	y = 4;
	print x + y;
	```
2.	Variables must be declared and assigned on separate lines.
	### Correct
	```
	int x;
	x = 2;
	print x;
	```
	### Incorrect
	```
	int x = 2;
	print x;
	```
3.	Rather than using scanf(), user input can be read using "read &ltvariable name&gt;".
	### Correct
	```
	int x;
	read x;
	print x;
	```
	### Incorrect
	```
	int x;
	scanf("%d", &x);
	print x;
	```
4.	Rather than using printf(), values can be output to the console using "print &ltvariable name&gt;" or "print &ltnumerical expression&gt;".
	### Correct
	```
	int x;
	x = 5 + 5 * 20;
	print x;
	print 2;
	print -1--1;
	print (4 + 2) / 17 + 8;
	print 10 % 3;
	```
	As can be seen above, operator precendence, as well as the modulo (%) and negation (-) operators, are supported in expression evaluation.
	### Incorrect
	```
	int x;
	x = 5 + 5 * 20;
	printf("%d\n", x);
	printf("%d\n, 2);
	printf("%d\n, 10 % 3);
	```
5.	Variable incrementation and decrementation must be writting using the long-hand notation.
	### Correct
	```
	int x;
	read x;
	x = x + 1;
	print x;
	x = x - 1;
	print x;
	```
	### Incorrect
	```
	int x;
	read x;
	x++;
	print x;
	x--;
	print x;
	```
6.	The less-than-or-equal-to and greater-than-or-equal-to operations must be written using the long-hand notation.
	### Correct
	```
	int x;
	x = 1;
	while (x < 100 || x == 100) {
		print x;
		x = x + 1;
	}
	```
	### Incorrect
	```
	int x;
	x = 1;
	while (x <= 100) {
		print x;
		x = x + 1;
	}
	```
7.	Memory management, functions, arrays, and use of libraries are not supported.
# Usage
### Install GCC (if not already installed)
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential
```
### Install Clang (if not already installed)
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install clang
```
### Write a SimpleC program
Create whatever program you like as long as it adheres to the syntax explained above. Save your program with the extension .simplec, e.g., "filename.simplec".
### Compile and Run C2LLVM.c
```
gcc C2LLVM.c -o &ltfilename&gt.out
./&ltfilename&gt.out &ltfilename&gt.simplec > &ltfilename&gt.ll
```
Replace &ltfilename&gt with the filename of your SimpleC program (excluding the file extension of your file).

These two commands will compile the compiler and then run it on your SimpleC program. The output will be inside &ltfilename&gt.ll. This file contains the LLVM IR code, generated by the compiler, that corresponds to your SimpleC program. You can open &ltfilename&gt.ll with any text editor, such as Notepad, to see what the resulting LLVM IR code looks like.
### Run the LLVM IR
```
clang <filename>.ll -o groundtruth.out
./groundtruth.out
```
